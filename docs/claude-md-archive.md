# Claude Code Configuration

STRICT RULE: NEVER post comments, replies, or questions on external platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) on behalf of the user without explicit, per-instance approval. This applies even if I have 'glab' or 'gh' tools authenticated.

## ADB Best Practices
- after launching an activity or otherwise changing UI view to perform a test or screenshot, return focus to the starting app/element - "leave no trace"
- if you change settings eg input method for a test, restore the original setting when done
- NEVER REBOOT or clear app data without explicit permission for that specific instance
- ADB is set to automatically reconnect upon disconnect
- always attempt to grep existing logcat before clearing - but pay close attention to timestamps to ensure you are not looking at previous version/test outcome
- do not mention 'Claude' in commit messages and remove the 'co-authored by'. instead sign with emdash + model version

## Quick Start Workflows

### Research Workflow
```bash
# Start a research swarm with distributed coordination
./claude-flow swarm "Research modern web frameworks" --strategy research --mode distributed --parallel --monitor

# Or use SPARC researcher mode for focused research
./claude-flow sparc run researcher "Analyze React vs Vue vs Angular performance characteristics"

# Store findings in memory for later use
./claude-flow memory store "research_findings" "Key insights from framework analysis"
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start orchestration system with web UI
./claude-flow start --ui --port 3000

# Run TDD workflow for new feature
./claude-flow sparc tdd "User authentication system with JWT tokens"

# Development swarm for complex projects
./claude-flow swarm "Build e-commerce API with payment integration" --strategy development --mode hierarchical --max-agents 8 --monitor

# Check system status
./claude-flow status
```

### Analysis Workflow
```bash
# Analyze codebase performance
./claude-flow sparc run analyzer "Identify performance bottlenecks in current codebase"

# Data analysis swarm
./claude-flow swarm "Analyze user behavior patterns from logs" --strategy analysis --mode mesh --parallel --output sqlite

# Store analysis results
./claude-flow memory store "performance_analysis" "Bottlenecks identified in database queries"
```

### Maintenance Workflow
```bash
# System maintenance with safety controls
./claude-flow swarm "Update dependencies and security patches" --strategy maintenance --mode centralized --monitor

# Security review
./claude-flow sparc run reviewer "Security audit of authentication system"

# Export maintenance logs
./claude-flow memory export maintenance_log.json
```

## Integration Patterns

### Memory-Driven Coordination
Use Memory to coordinate information across multiple SPARC modes and swarm operations:

```bash
# Store architecture decisions
./claude-flow memory store "system_architecture" "Microservices with API Gateway pattern"

# All subsequent operations can reference this decision
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement user service based on system_architecture in memory"
./claude-flow sparc run tester "Create integration tests for microservices architecture"
```

### Multi-Stage Development
Coordinate complex development through staged execution:

```bash
# Stage 1: Research and planning
./claude-flow sparc run researcher "Research authentication best practices"
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication system architecture"

# Stage 2: Implementation
./claude-flow sparc tdd "User registration and login functionality"
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement JWT token management"

# Stage 3: Testing and deployment
./claude-flow sparc run tester "Comprehensive security testing"
./claude-flow swarm "Deploy authentication system" --strategy maintenance --mode centralized
```

### Enterprise Integration
For enterprise environments with additional tooling:

```bash
# Project management integration
./claude-flow project create "authentication-system"
./claude-flow project switch "authentication-system"

# Security compliance
./claude-flow security scan
./claude-flow security audit

# Analytics and monitoring
./claude-flow analytics dashboard
./claude-flow deploy production --monitor
```

## Advanced Batch Tool Patterns

### TodoWrite Coordination
Always use TodoWrite for complex task coordination:

```javascript
TodoWrite([
  {
    id: "architecture_design",
    content: "Design system architecture and component interfaces",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "high",
    dependencies: [],
    estimatedTime: "60min",
    assignedAgent: "architect"
  },
  {
    id: "frontend_development",
    content: "Develop React components and user interface",
    status: "pending",
    priority: "medium",
    dependencies: ["architecture_design"],
    estimatedTime: "120min",
    assignedAgent: "frontend_team"
  }
]);
```

### Task and Memory Integration
Launch coordinated agents with shared memory:

```javascript
// Store architecture in memory
Task("System Architect", "Design architecture and store specs in Memory");

// Other agents use memory for coordination
Task("Frontend Team", "Develop UI using Memory architecture specs");
Task("Backend Team", "Implement APIs according to Memory specifications");
```

## Code Style Preferences
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax
- Destructure imports when possible
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use async/await instead of Promise chains
- Prefer const/let over var

## Workflow Guidelines
- Always run typecheck after making code changes
- Run tests before committing changes
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before merging

## Important Notes
- **Use TodoWrite extensively** for all complex task coordination
- **Leverage Task tool** for parallel agent execution on independent work
- **Store all important information in Memory** for cross-agent coordination
- **Use batch file operations** whenever reading/writing multiple files
- **Check .claude/commands/** for detailed command documentation
- **All swarm operations include automatic batch tool coordination**
- **Monitor progress** with TodoRead during long-running operations
- **Enable parallel execution** with --parallel flags for maximum efficiency

This configuration ensures optimal use of Claude Code's batch tools for swarm orchestration and parallel task execution with full Claude-Flow capabilities.
